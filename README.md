# Mandelbrot
A quick mandelbrot image/movie generator, designed for speed and accuracy with custom fixed-point arithmetic. Written for my IB Extended Essay in high school, and consequently quick&dirty. Written entirely in C++ with some helper shell scripts. Designed to test optimizations, including Nvidia CUDA parallelization.
